#### IAM -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Console, UI, API 
IAM Principal must be authenticated to send requests
A principal is a user or app, role, federated User that can make a request for an action or operation on AWS Resource

Policies define the permissions for identities or resources they are associated with

Types
Identity Based Policy - Users, groups & role
Resource Based Policy - Resources such as s3 buckets or dynamo DB, VPC Endpoints

Role are assumed by users,applications,services & delegated

AWS determines approve/deny

Identity Based JSON - Version, Sid, Action, Resource, Effect
Resource Based JSON - Version, Sid, Action(API action s3:*), Resource(ARN of specific Resource), Effect, Principal(user/role)
Trust Policy(Resource Based) - Effect(allow/deny), Prinicipal(ec2.amazon.com) Action(sts:assumeRole) assigned to Role

Physcial tokens come from 3rd parties

STS - temporary credentials include access key,secret key, session token , expiration
Temporary credentials are used with identity federation, delegation, cross account and IAM Roles

can change/enforce Password Policy
inline polices have 1-1 relationship with user, group or role

#### EC2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EBS Volume is virtual hard drive

User Data- dsts that can be entered when instance starts liek installing web server
Metadata - get useeful infro about instance . curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4

Elastic network interface - multiple types check docs ENA, EFA

Placement Groups 
Cluster - High Performance & low latency (HPC) 
Partition - Databases with Partinioning on different hardware.
Spread - instances always run on separate hosts.

ENI, ENA, EFA
EC2 istance is actually deployed in AZ
ENI - Multiple ENI's can connect to EC2 instances - they can be in different subnets but have to be in same AZ (No requirements & for all instance types)
ENA - Enahnced networkign Performance . High bandwith & inter instance latency. Must choose instance type
EFA - High Network Performance. Tightly coupled applications & all instance types

Bastion Hosts - insatnce in public subnet can connect to instance in private subnet
NAT Gateways - outbound connection to internet in private subnet. It can only be deployed in Public Subnet & has elastic ip

AWS Nitro - next gen infrastuctrure. Most optimised & hig Performance
AWS Nitro Enclaves - high Security like PII, health care data etc.

Pricing Options
OnDemand - standard rate not discount. short term or unpredictable workloads
Reserved - committed 1 or 3year. Large Discount usefuk for services that needs to run all time
Spot - Great discounts , instances can be terminated at any time. useful for instances that can recover if they are terminate in the middle. 2 min warning
Scheduled Reserved - Runs on scheduled basis uninterrupted. Sunset in the future
Dedicated instances - separate hardware only for you. Pay per instance expensive
Dedicated Hosts - Physical Server dedicated for yout use. Pay per Host expensive
Savings Plans - Commitment to consistent usage. Pay by hour, 1 or 3 year commitment.

Billing
Amazon linux & onDemand - Reserved, OnDemand & Spot - Billed per second
Widows, Redhatm SUSE - Billed per hour
EBS - Per second with min of 1 minute

Spot Block - Run interrupted for certain time

AutoScaling & Load Balancing

Create Launch template & then ASG

Group metrics  ASG - free every 1min
cloud watch - every 5 min
Detailed Monitoring - every 1min comes with cost

####Load Balancers -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALB - Operates at request level. Layer 7 http/https. Supports Path based routing, host based query string. Supports instances, IP addresses, Lambda, ECS as targets
NLB - Operates at conneciton level. Layer 4 TCP/UDP/TLS,TCP_UDP. High Perrformance, low latenct & TLS offloading. Static/Elastic IP supports UDP and static IP or onpremises as targets.
Classic - Deprecated. Performas at layer 4 & 7. Use for existing apps running in EC2 Classic
GLB - virtual appliances such as firewalls, IDS/IPS and deep packet inspection systems, Operates at layer 3. Geneve Protocol at 6081

Create Target Group & create ALB (attach TG to ALB)
Attach TG to ASG

#### AWS Organization -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
manage multiple accounts 
create new accounts
consolidated Billing for all accounts - can also get discounts combining aggregated usage
All features - ADD SCPS & tags which Api services to use
Enable SSO on prem directory
Enable cloud trail in mgmt ccount and apply to all members
Users in management account are not affected by SCPS
SCPS do not grant permissions, they control available permissions
Organizational Unit - Test, Prod add accounts underneath OU & add SCPs to OU's - this will apply to all accounts
Tag policies enforce tag standardizations
